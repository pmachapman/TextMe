# TextMe

TextMe is a Drag and Drop note database. It is handy as a quick note jotting space or to copy text notes over from other documents or websites. TextMe currently only supports plain text notes.

The beauty of the TextMe system is its flexibility. Using Windows standard text files and folders to store information, it can be customised outside of TextMe.
