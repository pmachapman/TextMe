Welcome To TextMe!

TextMe is a fully Drag and Drop notes organiser. Simply drag text from the text box to copy a selection of text or a note from the notes list to your left to copy an entire note.

Even drag text or a file from the Desktop into TextMe to create a note from the file or text you dragged.


Handy Tips:

Handy Tip #1: Add ".txt" (without the quotation marks) to the end of the name of your note to make your note turn into a text file when you drag it to the Desktop.

Handy Tip #2: Use the Settings Dialog to modify how TextMe acts.

Handy Tip #3: Hold the mouse over any button to see a brief description of what that button does.

Handy Tip #4: Keep TextMe up-to-date! Click the Update button above. (Requires an Internet Connection)

Handy Tip #6: Hold down Shift while clicking Delete to delete all notes in the note database.

NOTE: If TextMe crashes or does something it is not meant to (eg  TextMe changes the wrong note when the right note is selected) please email a description of what has happened and what triggered it if possible, to DukeSpukem@Hotmail.com
