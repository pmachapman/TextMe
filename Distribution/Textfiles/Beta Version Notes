As this is a beta version of TextMe, it is highly recommended that you also install the Salamander Extensions, as it adds error logging. Once a crash occurs, you can email me that log and a description of what triggered the crash, enabling me to fix this bug before the final version is released.

Download the Salamander Extesnions from:

As with all of my software, use at your own risk, but use especial caution with this version, and keep backups!
